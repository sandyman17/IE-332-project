weight of similarities between movies
	is it better for a recommendation to have the same director or better to have a similar watch time?

how to host website

how many movies to recommend?

language should be a big factor but some people enjoy subtitles


profile weighting and recommendation score example:

profile weighting:
	leading actor = 0.2
	director = 0.3
	watch time = 0.05
	main genre = 0.3
	support actors = 0.05
	setting = 0.1

similarities between movie 1(what they watched) and 2(what we might recommend):

director
supporting actor
main genre
setting

comparison score = 0.3 + 0.05 + 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.75

similarities between movie 1(what they watched) and 3(what we might recommend):

director
lead actor
setting
main genre

comparison score = 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.9

we recommend movie 3 over movie 2 to the user
